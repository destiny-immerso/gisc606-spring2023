        "your_summary": "This arcticle addresses the need for Landscape Assessments over periods of time and over multiple regions regarding burns from fires 
        using two types of remote sensing methodologies: Normalized Burn Ratio & Composite Burn Index. NBR uses data sets from prefires and posfires to determine 
        the extent and degree of the burns and its affects for the next season. CBI uses field sampling to analyze potential vegetation recovery and delayed morality."
